# MW Static Comp Challenge 1

One Paragraph of project description goes here. Our challenge was to replicate the static comp provided by the Turing Front-End Module 1 Program found here:

Our challenge was to replicate the static comp provided by the Turing Front-End Module 1 Program found here. I kept the same layout, proportions, and ethos of the design. This is my desktop layout.

And this is my mobile layout at a 320px width.

I chose to recreate the comp for a local Non-Profit called Colorado CRUSH. I took a photo of a sample mural from the festival and sized it to work for both the desktop and mobile layouts. Because CRUSH is a grass-roots, community based Non-Profit, I chose to make their primary buttons about fundraising (support) and getting in touch. I then chose to focus the action of the site on learning more about the artists, the festivals, and visiting with virtual reality or in person. A common user issue for attendees is wanting to know who painted a mural and where that mural can be found - features not available on the current site. 

There were several challenges in this exercise. Keeping the integrity of the comp intention while also making it responsive was achieved using 'flexbox' in the CSS. While the comp's tiles are square, I allowed for more flexibility in the proportions as the design changes size to keep the tiles and images flush with no white space visible to the user. 

To highlight that Colorado CRUSH is part of the RiNo Art's District Community, I used the RiNo logo as one of my icons and placed it at the bottom of the design as an 'about' section. I also styled this to be a wider tile on mobile than the comp specified to give the user the feeling that they reached the end of the page and that in the RiNo tile they could find more information about the parent organization.

Moving forward, I would like to style the carousel radio buttons to match the comp design. I would also like to bring in more images from the festival and to pick a unifying color scheme that both complements a wide variety of art pieces and helps to develop a visual identity for the CRUSH festival. CRUSH also has a graffiti style logo that I would like to incorporate. Because their was no organizational logo in the comp, I left that out in this iteration for the challenge to keep the integrity of the comp.


# About Colorado CRUSH

MISSION - CREATIVE RITUALS UNDER SOCIAL HARMONY

CRUSH celebrates art, urban beautification, creativity, and culture by enriching a community through an arts festival like no other. We believe that public art leads to an improved community as a catalyst for safety, cleanliness, creativity, and conversation. Centered around empowering artists, CRUSH is committed to reflecting and diversifying the urban landscape and the unique voice of a community, bringing art out of the galleries and into the streets.

CRUSH started and still finds its home in RiNo (River North) Art District which defines itself as a community "Where Art is Made‚Äù. CRUSH celebrates the craft of graffiti and street artists who bring life to walls while maintaining the unique cultural identity in this rapidly evolving community. The annual event transforms streets and alleys into the largest open-air galleries.

CRUSH raises awareness of the cultural significance and importance of art for all ages and all demographics that may not have the opportunity to experience it otherwise. CRUSH offers art inspiration through this urban craft. The organization serves as a forum for community engagement and creative expression, inviting locals and visitors to engage in this rich history and through forward-thinking public art in Denver, Colorado. Join the experience during the annual event in Mid-September or visit the CRUSH Walls year round in the RiNo Art District area.
